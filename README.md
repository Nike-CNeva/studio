# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Running the FastAPI Backend

To run the FastAPI backend, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

This will start the server, typically on `http://localhost:8000`. Ensure you have Python installed and the required dependencies (e.g., FastAPI, uvicorn) are installed.  You can install these using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```
